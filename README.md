# IBMx-Python-for-Data-Science
This repository is for the two major projects I completed while learning Python via edx.org's IBMx Python for Data Science, completed in September 2020.

The **first** hands-on project in the course involved the use of an Application Programming Interface (API) from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to obtain basketball statistics. I worked on this in Python using PyCharm as my text editor and debugger. [Access the code on GitHub for this project.](https://github.com/kaatori/IBMx-Python-for-Data-Science/blob/b8a64f395895b327462f2fb50e03445db26f3569/nba_api%20public%20gist%20code.py)

The **second** project was the final assignment of the course. It was a web scraping project where I scraped basketball data from Wikipedia HTML tables. [Access the Google Colab notebook for the web scraper project (embedded link).](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PT1glMSLZjesagY-PskurAZGKX88L0Ar#scrollTo=66Oc7PKi9c7d) 

A number of the hands-on labs I completed as part of the course are available in my Gists: https://gist.github.com/kaatori
