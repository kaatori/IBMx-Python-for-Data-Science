# IBMx-Python-for-Data-Science
This repository is for the two major projects I completed while learning Python via edx.org's IBMx Python for Data Science, completed in September 2020.

The first hands-on project in the course involved the use of an Application Programming Interface (API) from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to obtain basketball statistics. I worked on this in Python using PyCharm as my text editor and debugger. 

The second project was the final assignment of the course. It was a web scraping project where I scraped basketball data from Wikipedia HTML tables.

A number of the hands-on labs I completed as part of the course are available in my Gists: https://gist.github.com/kaatori
