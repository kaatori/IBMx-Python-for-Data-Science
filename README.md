# IBMx-Python-for-Data-Science
This repository is for the two major projects I completed while learning Python via edx.org's IBMx Python for Data Science, completed in September 2020.

The first hands-on project in the course involved the use of an Application Programming Interface (API) from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to obtain basketball statistics. I worked on this in Python using PyCharm as my text editor and debugger. 

The second project was the final assignment of the course. It was a web scraping project where I scraped basketball data from Wikipedia HTML tables. It was visually easier to do this project in Google Colaboratory ("Colab"), but one can open any Colab file with Jupyter Notebooks as well. 

A number of the hands-on labs I completed as part of the course are available in my Gists: https://gist.github.com/kaatori
