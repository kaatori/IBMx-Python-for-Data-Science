# IBMx-Python-for-Data-Science
This repository is for the two major projects I completed while learning Python via edx.org's IBMx Python for Data Science, completed in September 2020.

Sequentially, the first project in the course was using an API from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to obtain basketball statistics.

The second project was the final assignment. It was a web scraping project where I scraped basketball data from Wikipedia HTML tables.
