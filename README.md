# IBMx-Python-for-Data-Science
This repository is for the two major projects I completed while learning Python via edx.org's IBMx Python for Data Science, completed in September 2020.

Sequentially, the first project in the course was using an API from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to obtain basketball statistics. I worked on this Python file using PyCharm as my text editor. 

The second project was the final assignment. It was a web scraping project where I scraped basketball data from Wikipedia HTML tables. It was easier to do this project in Google Colab, but one can open any Colab file with Jupyter Notebooks as well.
